# Kakapo_genomics

This repository contains code and resources to replicate the analyses from Urban et al. (2023) The ghost of selection past: evolution and conservation relevance of the kākāpō color polymorphism (prerint, currently under revision by PLOS Biology: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.25.559367v2), in which we leveraged detailed phenotypic and genomic data of nearly all living kākāpō to understand the evolution of its remarkable feather color polymorphism. 

We provide code to process the genomic data, replicate all SLiM genomic simulations and optical smoothness analyses, and provide stable access to the RepeatABEL tool. 

All kākāpō population genomic data and the genetic variant callset are available via an application form since access to the data is controlled by a data committee composed of the Aotearoa New Zealand Department of Conservation and Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu: https://www.doc.govt.nz/our-work/kakapo-recovery/what-we-do/research-for-the-future/kakapo125-gene-sequencing/request-kakapo125-data/
